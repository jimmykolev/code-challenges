# Coding Challenges

This repository is a collection of coding challenges I'm working on from Coding Challenges by FYI.

Here you'll find solutions for various problems, helping you hone your coding skills and explore different algorithms and data structures.

Challenges

Each challenge is stored in its own directory. The directory name typically reflects the challenge name or ID. Inside each directory, you'll find:

Problem Statement (README.md): A brief description of the challenge and the expected outcome. (This line is indented with four spaces)
Solution Files: Code files containing the solution in one or more programming languages (depending on the challenge). (This line is indented with four spaces)
Tests (Optional): Test cases to verify the solution's correctness (if applicable). (This line is indented with four spaces)
